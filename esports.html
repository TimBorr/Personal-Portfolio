<h1>Competitive Gaming Journey</h1>
        <p>Throughout my life, I’ve always had a strong competitive spirit, consistently pushing myself to excel and take things to the next level. This drive led me to pursue professional gaming, where I’ve found great success in a variety of competitive titles. My expertise lies primarily in strategy games such as Overwatch 2, Yu-Gi-Oh!, and Cardfight!! Vanguard.
I’ve achieved notable success in these games, leading teams that have earned over $1,000 in winnings. 
In addition to my competitive achievements, I’ve leveraged my deep knowledge of these markets to build a profitable side business through coaching, trading, and selling, utilizing data analysis tools to maximize returns. My ability to combine strategic insight with market analysis has resulted in consistent financial growth and a valuable skill set that I’m eager to apply in new professional opportunities.</p>

                        <h5 class="Cardfight-Vangaurd">Cardfight Vanguard 1</h5>
                        <p class="card-text">Throughout my 10-year tenure competing in card games, I’ve achieved several notable accomplishments. In 2014, I secured 1st place at the ARG Atlanta Regional Tournament, which hosted over 300 players. That same year, I led my team to an 8th place finish at the Bushiroad Springfest Team Championships. Leveraging my deep understanding of the game’s current state, I collaborated with my team to create a winning strategy.

In 2020, during the pandemic, I joined an Esports startup called Vision, serving as their Event Coordinator and Judge. I successfully organized a global team event that attracted over 1,000 paying participants. The team I led finished in the top 8 of the entire event.

Throughout my journey with Cardfight!! Vanguard, I’ve embraced the importance of accountability and coachability. I firmly believe that no match is played perfectly—there’s always room for improvement. Rewatching old matches and learning from mistakes has been a cornerstone of my competitive growth.</p>
